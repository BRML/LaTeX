\maketitle

You don't know who Donald Knuth is?  Stop reading here.  This document is not for you.  But if you do,
you may have more satisfaction from reading the \TeX book than these few lines.   Do so, please.
Here may be a surprise for you: it is probably on your computer.

\section{Language}
Beware your spelling bugs.  You can squeeze them before giving your document to someone else, it saves
a few iterations and many irritations.  Note that you can decide whether you use US English or
British English (BE) spelling.  Some notable differences include the following words:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}
British English & US English \\\hline
colour, flavour, humour, etc.	& color, flavor, humor, etc.\\
centre, fibre, etc.	& center, fiber, etc.\\
aluminium			& aluminum
\end{tabular}\end{center}
but this list is far from complete.  See, e.g., \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences}{a corresponding wiki page}.

In BE, you can also choose for the ``-ise'' rather than ``-ize'' ending, depending on which
dictionary you adhere to.  To my best of knowledge, Oxford uses ``minimize,'' ``minimization,'' etc.\
while Chambers dictates ``minimise,'' ``minimising,'' etc.  Statistically, ``-ise'' is preferred in BE.

An interesting anomaly is that, in US English, punctuation is \textsl{always} within quotes.  
I used that style in this document, but BE does not prefer that anymore.


\subsection{ll}
``All, till, full, and well, \\
always have double l\\
except in compounds.''

\vskip1ex\noindent
(So why does \TeX\ write \verb+overfull+?  And what about underfull?  Overfulfil, or is it overfulfill?
Woeful, all of this.) 

\subsection{a or an?}
Everyone knows that ``an'' is used before a vowel, ``a'' before a consonant.  But that refers to the
\textsl{sound} that follows, not to the spelling!  So please write, ``modern physics discovered that
the constant indicated by \textbf{an} h is no longer relevant.''


\subsection{Dash}
The dash rule in English is really very, very simple (I am talking en-dashes here).  Generally, adverbs and adjectives are connected by a dash.  To help you refresh your grammar: an adjective describes a noun.  An adverb describes an adjective.

So, for instance, when we write ``the red-beaten man,'' we refer to a man who was beaten until red.  The adverb ``red'' describes a property of ``beaten,'' not of man.  If, however, we write ``the red beaten man'' (or, more clearly, ``the red, beaten man''), the poor chap was red before being beaten.

So, write ``the two-dimensional manifold'' but ``the two dimensional manifolds'' (though I would not know what a ``dimensional manifold'' is).  Write the ``light-weight robot'' (although the whole name is clearly given by individuals who have no understanding of the English language: a weight is not light, but it can be low).


\section{\LaTeX\ typesetting}
\subsection{Commands}
A quick one about commands.  Many \LaTeX\ and \TeX\ commands take one or more 
arguments. How does \TeX\ know when a command ends? The rules, which can be
redefined, are simple in normal (``plain'') mode:
	a command starts with a \textbackslash\ followed by a single
  	non-alpha character, or one or more alpha character.  So,
	\verb+\!+ is defined as being one character (after the backslash)
	long only, but \verb+\ashdhf+ only ends when the first non-alpha
	character is seen.

If an alpha command is followed by one or more spaces, these spaces are interpreted as an end-of-command
character, and does not render a space in the text.  So, when I write \verb+\TeX is great+ I don't
get what I want.

You can use this rule to your advantage.  For instance, \verb+\frac2n+ yields exactly the
same as \verb+\frac{2}{n}+, but \verb+\fracn2+ goes bitterly wrong.  In math mode,
why not write \verb+$n^2$+ rather than \verb+$n^{2}$+ (yes, \verb+^+ is also a special
control character, as are \verb+$#%&{}_~+.  Which did I miss?)
 
\subsection{Space control}
It is worth understanding the spacing algorithm in \TeX. The intricacies go beyond this short section,
but the principle is as follows.  \TeX\ defines glue between words, sentences, etc.  This glue can
be compared with a spring, having a base length, which can be compressed by a certain amount,
and which can be extended by a certain amount.  Normally, two words are separated by some 
horizontal glue, as are two lines, by vertical glue.  \TeX\ then goes on defining the length of a sentence,
for instance, and of a page, which also have some flexibility (in the order of picas).

Since the amount of glue is not infinite, there are cases where \TeX cannot fill a page or line
with the amount of glue available.  You may find an example in Sec.~\ref{sec:refereq}.
So, \TeX\ gives up and outputs an error message (\verb+overfull \hbox+).

You really need to scan your log file for such errors.  And repair them!  There are a few things
you can do.  The best thing is to reformulate your sentence, or help \TeX\ break words
with the \verb+\-+ command.  If you are lazy, however, you can use \verb+\tolerance10000+
in the preamble of the document.  For \TeX, 10,000 is the same as infinity, and this means that
the corresponding glues can be extended up ``infinity.''  You will never end up with overfull
hboxes---but you will probably get \verb+underfull+ ones!

After a full stop \textsl{not} following a capital letter, \TeX\ assumes the end of a sentence
and adds more glue (i.e., more stretch).  Sometimes you don't want this, and you can prevent
this extra glue with a \textbackslash\ (followed by a space) or a \textasciitilde\ (\textsl{not followed by a space}).
The latter does not break along lines.
To make things more intuitive, this also holds beyond a '' or a ).  So, type
\verb+I think, viz.\ I am+
to yield ``I think, viz.\ I am''
rather than ``I think, viz. I am.''
Do you notice the difference?  I do.  Depending on how much the space has to be stretched to fill
a line, \TeX\ will do that after a full stop.


\verb+\raggedright+ and \verb+\raggedbottom+ switch off \TeX's line and page filling algorithms.
The latter is, by default, off in article mode.


\paragraph{To paragraphs.}
Creating a new paragraph in \TeX\ is simply done by leaving a line blank.
The previous line will be terminated, a new paragraph will be started after a 
length of \verb+\parskip+ and indented by \verb+\parindent+.  Use this.  If you really
cannot use the indent on the next line, don't use \verb+\\+ but instead write 
\verb+\noindent+ before the next paragraph.  Use \verb+\\+ only if you
\textsl{really} want a newline.

Of course, don't create a new paragraph when, for instance, your text goes on with
a displayed equation!  It will add spurious space, your fault.


\subsection{Dashes}
Watch the use of dashes.  For numerical ranges, use \verb+--+.  Use three 
dashes to isolate---as in this example---a
subsentence.  In equations, the dash is transformed to a minus. 
So never write \verb+-1+ yielding -1, instead use \verb+$-1$+ giving $-1$.

No spaces around dashes, except preceding a minus sign, of course!

\subsection{Dots}
Use \verb+\dots+ for $1,2,\dots,n$, I'm sure%
\footnote{a bit tricky: the sentence ends with \protect\verb+\dots\ + to make sure
there is a bit of space after the dots.}%
\dots\ But for $1+2+\cdots+n$ you should use \verb-[1+2+\cdots+n]-. In math mode there are
also $\vdots$ (\verb+$\vdots$+) and $\ddots$ (\verb+$\ddots$+).

\subsection{Quotes}
British English prefers single quotes, but you can do double.  Whatever you
do---be consistent throughout your text!

To type quotes in \LaTeX, use \verb+``+ and \verb+''+ (or, of course, their single variants).  The more
general \verb+\lq+ (for left quote) and \verb+\rq+ will render the right quotes in the Babel
language that you are typesetting.

\section{Figures and tables}
Most authors cannot drive \LaTeX\ well in placing these.  In fact, \LaTeX\ offers a very nice
set of macros for placing and naming these.  You need just write
\verb+\begin{figure} ... \end{figure}+ and remember that the label must always come
\textsl{after} the caption, and you are fine.  Same for tables, but here the caption should
\textsl{precede} the table contents.

Now, since the table caption comes before the table and the figure caption after the figure,
typesetting rules dictate that, where possible, figures are at the top of a page and
tables at the bottom.  \TeX\ tries to do that for you, and in most cases you need never
to worry about this anymore.

\textsl{Please} refrain from using these \verb+[hbtp!]+ position modifiers if you don't need
to.  By default, \TeX\ does a very good job in placing them.  Also, please refrain from putting
a figure in the middle of a column, unless you have a very good reason!

Refer to figures with \verb+Fig.~\ref{...}+ and to tables with \verb+Tab.~\ref{...}+.


\section{Citing}
There are two things to correct citing in \LaTeX.  First, there is putting the cite in the
paper. Quite an easy thing to do, by typing \verb+\cite{ref1,ref2,ref3}+. Note that
multiple cites are all included in one cite command.

The Bib\TeX\ entry itself must be carefully constructed.  Many people like to use
bib management programs, such as the public-domain tool JabRef.  Fine, but you
still must feed it with the right info:
\begin{itemize}
\item for a journal publication, you must add title, author, year, volume number,
pages, and possibly issue number.  Pages are written as \verb+5--10+, but if
you write \verb+5-10+ in a Bib\TeX\ entry, it will automatically translate that
to \verb+5--10+ for you.  Under no circumstance use three dashes!
\item for a conference publication, don't add info on where the conference was.
The \verb+address+ field is to specify the address of the publisher house, and quite
irrelevant for these kind of publications.

If you have them, specify page numbers.  Then, of course, title, authors, name of the 
conference.
\end{itemize}

\section{Equations}
\subsection{Referring to equations}\label{sec:refereq}
When having a displayed equation such as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schroedinger}
i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi + V(\mathbf{r})\psi
\end{equation}
we can say that thanks to Sch\"odinger we know Eq.~(\ref{eq:schroedinger}) which
is typed in as \verb+Eq.~(\ref{eq:schroedinger})+.

\subsection{Punctuation in equations}

These things are easy to answer, as easy as
$$ \pi r^2.$$
If an equation, for instance
$$ E = m c^2, $$
is part of a sentence, of course normal punctuation must be applied.  It makes no sense adding a comma after an equation such as 
$$ f(\vec x) = \sum_i x_i $$
when a comma has no place there.

Oh, of course, punctuation should be within a display equation but outside an inline equation.

But there are some caveats.  For instance, the comma in equations is a punctuation symbol.
To change that, put it in braces to say, for instance, \verb+$10{,}000|x|$ is not less than $|x|$+.

\subsection{Give them space}
Quite a tricky business, getting spacing in equations right.  But doing it right will tremendously
improve the readability of equations, which is key to have your reader follow your writing.

In general, put in a bit of space before a derivative symbol: \verb+$a\,dx/dy$+ is right.
Also, deleting the space in \verb+$x^2\!/2$+ gives $x^2\!/2$, much nicer than $x^2/2$.
As is adding some in \verb+$\sqrt2\,x$+ to yield $\sqrt2\,x$ (compare $\sqrt2x$).

\subsection{Units}
Units are, in general, written according to ISO style and that means, you use ``s'' for seconds, ``m'' for metres, etc.  Make them roman (meaning, not slanted, not italics) and separate them from the number by half a space.  So you write \verb+I am 1.86\,m long and vibrate at 4\,Hz+ to yield ``I am 1.86\,m long, about 1,451,673,446,400\,ms old, and vibrate at 1\,Hz'' and don't use math mode!  

But, we write 75\%. And $25^\circ$C as \verb+$25^\circ$C+.


\subsection{italics or roman?}
By default, equations are built from single-letter symbols, e.g., $f(x) = ax+b$.  But sometimes it makes
sense to write variables in a more wordy fashion.  People sometimes like to write $vel = d pos / d t$.  As
you can see from the typesetting, this goes horribly wrong!  If you really need to write multi-letter
variables describing some physical quantity, use \verb+\mathrm+, as in
\verb+$\mathrm{vel} = d \mathrm{pos} / dt$+ to render $\mathrm{vel} = d \mathrm{pos} / dt$.

\subsection{Multiplying}
One sees many symbols for scalars multiplication.  There is the \verb+\times+ displayed as $\times$,
or the \verb+\cdot+ aka $\cdot$, sometimes even \verb+\ast+, i.e., $\ast$.

Just don't.  For engineers: $\cdot$ is, in general, the inner (or dot) product, $\times$ the 
outer product, and $\ast$ means convolution\footnote{But, of course, these are only
general conventions and not laws.  Indeed, there exist equations where throwing in
a \verb+\cdot+ to indicate scalar multiplication may actually clarify things.}. To write
$a$ times $x$, just type \verb+$ax$+ yielding $ax$.


\subsection{Fractioning}
Sure, you use \verb+$\frac12$+ to write $\frac12$, while I myself prefer writing \verb+$1\over2$+ to obtain
the same (note my use of parentheses---or rather, not using them where I need not).
That is not worth discussing.  But ones things get more complex, such as $\frac a{\sqrt{1+q}}$, the whole
fraction increases in length, and lines get cramped or, even worse, the baseline stretch is increased.
At any rate, if your equation is so complex, by all means revert to writing $a/{\sqrt{1+q}}$.   Suggestion:
don't use fractions in inline equations, but use the simple / divider.  What is easier
to read, $\frac12$ or $1/2$?

\subsection{Vectorising}
Sometimes it is important to clear the difference between a vector and a scalar.
The standard way to indicate vectors is as $\vec x$, and that works fine if it is 
just one old vector lying around.  But when a whole bunch is involved, for instance
$$ \vec x \vec y + \vec b \vec a = 2,$$ the result looks silly.  Some people
prefer $$ \underline x \underline y + \underline b \underline a = 2$$ but, well,
judge yourself.  

One preferred way out is using boldface symbols.  If you do, do it right.  Get the \AmS math package and write,
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newcommand{\vect}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}} % I would write, \def\vect#1{\boldsymbol{#1}}
\end{verbatim}
to render $\boldsymbol{abc\phi\chi}$.
